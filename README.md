#  Sales Forecasting Using Machine Learning

This project demonstrates a full-cycle machine learning pipeline for **Sales Forecasting**, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. It is designed as part of a real-time internship with a structured step-by-step approach.

##  Project Structure

1. **Data Loading & Exploration**

   * Importing libraries
   * Loading the dataset (`train.csv`)
   * Initial exploration (`head()`, `info()`, `describe()`)

2. **Data Cleaning & Preprocessing**

   * Handling missing values
   * Converting date formats
   * Encoding categorical features

3. **Feature Engineering**

   * Extracting useful date parts (month, year, etc.)
   * Creating new features to enhance model performance

4. **Modeling & Forecasting**

   * Splitting data into training and testing sets
   * Using machine learning models (e.g., Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost)
   * Evaluating models using RMSE, MAE, and R¬≤ Score

5. **Conclusion**

   * Best model selected based on performance
   * Insights for improving sales strategy

##  How to Run

1. Clone the repository or download the `.ipynb` notebook.
2. Make sure you have Python and Jupyter Notebook installed.
3. Install required libraries:

   ```bash
   pip install pandas scikit-learn matplotlib seaborn xgboost
   ```
4. Run the notebook:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Sales_Forecasting.ipynb
   ```
