-- Sales Forecasting Using Linear Regression

-- Project Overview

This notebook presents a simple machine learning workflow to forecast sales based on historical data using Linear Regression. The objective is to predict future sales trends and visualize actual vs predicted sales, enabling data-driven decision-making for inventory or resource planning.

-- Dataset Requirements
File Format: .csv

-- Expected Columns:

Date – The date of the sale (required).

Product – Name or ID of the product.

Quantity – Number of units sold.

Revenue – Sales revenue.

-- Steps in the Notebook
-- Import Libraries

pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn, sklearn

-- Load & Inspect Data

Load CSV data into a DataFrame.

Handle missing values and check data types.

-- Preprocessing

Convert Date to datetime format.

Extract features like Day, Month, Year.

-- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Plot sales trends over time.

Identify seasonal patterns.

-- Model Building

Features: Day, Month, Year

Model: Linear Regression

Train-test split

Evaluation: MAE, MSE, RMSE

-- Future Forecasting

Generate the next 30 days of future dates.

--Predict future sales using the trained model.

--Visualization

Plot actual vs predicted sales.

Plot forecasted sales for upcoming days.

--Requirements
You can install all dependencies using:

pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scikit-learn

-- Output
Tabular prediction of future sales

Graphical comparison of actual vs predicted sales

Forecast plot for next 30 days

-- Notes
Model is a basic linear regression and may not capture complex trends.

For better accuracy, consider adding additional features like promotions, holidays, etc.
